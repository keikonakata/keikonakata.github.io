        <p>The paper proves that any consensus protocol that tolerates one process failure under the reliable (completely) asynchronous message system, in which all messages are eventually delivered with arbitrary delay and out of order, fails to reach consensus when messages are delivered in inappropriate timing.</p>
<p>The proof goes, quite elegantly, by showing a message delivery strategy which keeps consensus protocols forever indecisive.</p>
<p>Crucial assumption of the proof is complete asynchrony: no assumption about the relative speeds of processes or the delay time in delivering messages. In particular, processes do not have access to synchronized clocks.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<!--
Every process starts with an initial value in {0, 1}.
All processes that makes a decision are required to choose the same value.
Some process must eventually make a decision.
Both 0 and 1 must be possible decision values (perhaps for different initial configurations.)
-->
<p>A <em>configuration</em> is a state of the system, which consists of states of all the processes and a state of the message system. <em>Accessible</em> configurations are configurations that are reachable from an initial state.</p>
<p>A process decides on a value in {0, 1}, and decision cannot be changed or reversed.</p>
<p>A consensus protocol is <em>partially correct</em> if</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No accessible configuration has more than one decision value.</li>
<li>For each v in {0, 1}, some accessible configuration has decision value v. (This is to eliminate the trivial solution, in which, say, 0 is always chosen.)</li>
</ol>
<!--
A process is nonfaulty if it takes infinitely many steps, and it is faulty otherwise.
-->
<p>A run is <em>admissible</em> if at most one process is faulty and all messages sent to nonfaulty processes are eventually received (with arbitrary delay and possibly out of order). Therefore, we assume the message system is reliable – it delivers all messages correctly and exactly once. Moreover, an atomic broadcast capability is assumed – a process can send the same message in one step to all other processes.</p>
<p>A run is <em>deciding</em> if some process reaches a decision state.</p>
<h2 id="main-result">Main result</h2>
<p><strong>Any partially correct consensus protocol admits an admissible run which is not deciding.</strong></p>
<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>
<p>By contradiction: assume a partially correct consensus protocol, for which every run is deciding.</p>
<p>A configuration C is <em>bivalent</em> if, for i = 0, 1, i-decided configuration is reachable from an initial configuration. A configuration is <em>0-valent</em> (resp. <em>1-valent</em>) if any decided configuration reachable from an initial state has decided on 0 (resp. 1). A configuration is <em>univalent</em> if it is either 0-valent or 1-valent.</p>
<p>The crux is to prove a lemma, which states, for any bivalent configuration C and any step (p, m) that is applicable to C, there is a run from C to a bivalent configuration, whose last step is (p,m).</p>
<p>From this lemma, it is easy to construct an admissible run which is not deciding, by sending all messages eventually staying in bivalent configurations.</p>
<h5 id="proof-of-the-lemma.">Proof of the lemma.</h5>
<p>Let S be the set of configurations reachable from C and whose last step is (p,m).</p>
<p>Assume S only contains univalent configurations.</p>
<p>Since C is bivalent, S must contain both 0-valent and 1-valent configurations.</p>
<p>Without the loss of generality, we assume (p,m)(C) is 0-valent.</p>
<p>By induction, we obtain configuration C₀ such that (p,m)(C₀) is 0-valent and (p,m)(p’,m’)(C₀) is 1-valent for some (p’,m’).</p>
<p>If p is not p’, then (p’,m’)(p,m)(C₀) = (p’,m’)(p,m)(C₀). Contradiction. (0-valent configuration cannot be 1-valent at the same time.)</p>
<p>Assume p = p’.</p>
<p>Consider any deciding run from C₀ in which p takes no steps, and let σ be the corresponding schedule.</p>
<p>By our assumption, (p,m)σ(C₀) = σ(p,m)(C₀) is 0-valent, σ(p,m)(p,m’)(C₀) = (p,m)(p, m’)σ(C₀) is 1-valent.</p>
<p>However, since σ is a deciding run, σ(C₀) must be univalent. Contradiction. ∎</p>
